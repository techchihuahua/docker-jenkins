# docker-jenkins
Sample Docker for running Jenkins LTS master node, built with custom setup scripts.

For those stumbling upon this repo, please do not take anything about the Docker
setup as holy writ.  This setup is highly opinionated and based upon one particular
Jenkins install with which I have been toying around.  It is meant to be shared as
an example of a working Jenkins container based on the standard Jenkins LTS image.

There are plans for expanding upon what is presently here, but probably not in the
near future (unless time permits).

The Docker image is available on Docker hub, if you would like to pull it down and
give it a whirl.  I am open to constructive suggestions on how to improve the base
image and/or what plugins or default configuration to provide.
